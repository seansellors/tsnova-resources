Notes:

Some parts of the planets remain to be mapped. These “gaps” are filled with fictional terrain that corresponds with the rest of the landscape.

The colors are slightly more saturated in order to highlite a unique nature for each object.

Earth textures are the most precise part of the pack: They are a result of merging and adjusting large amount of geo-data, space photos and images from NASA’s Blue Marble (which might well be the 2nd best collection of Earth’s textures available, so check it out).

True Earth colors (as seen from space) may vary depending on the camera used, duration of exposure, lightning conditions and atmospheric conditions. Textures in our pack are sharp, bright and colorful.

Seasonal variations affect Earth’s flora and snow coverage. Earth in our textures has a lot of vegetation and less snow.
